        <p>Hello and welcome to my personal website! My name is <strong>Mehdi</strong> . I'm <em>Tunisian</em> and I'am a <em>geologist</em>.</p>
        <p> If someone is a Tunisian he stays a Tunisian all his life, no matter what happens.
          But what if he is a geologist, does he stay a geologist all his lifetime?</p>
        <p>Once a geolgist, forever a geologist?!</p>
        <p>
          As far as I'm concerned, it's a very hard question to answer. May be if
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bertrand_Russell">Bertrand Russel</a> was alive he could... but I can,t.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Anyway!</em>

    I'm learning <em>web development</em> , online , and this is the first website I created, using only
    <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML">HTML</a>.
    So, yes you guessed it ! I'm becoming a <em>web developer</em>, begining from scratch and I think that
    it's just a matter of time before I become good developer.</p>

  <p>
    In the last 3 years, I became interested in personal development.
  </p>
  <p>
    But when it comes to develop mentally, when it comes to making money, being happy and successful...etc.
  </p>
  <p>Who do you listen to ?</p>
  <p> Let's take making money as an example. Most people teaching others how to make money, are making their money teaching people how to make money.</p>
  <p> So they are salesmen. They are selling books and tapes...on how to make money. They haven't made any money in real life.</p>
  <p> So the answer to the question mentioned above is: Listen to people who have what you want, people that have the physical evidence that what they are teaching works.</p>
  <p> I learned this principle from a great man. An american billionnaire called Kevin Trudeau.</p>
  <p> He made a CD serie called Your Wish Is Your Command (You can look for it on <a href="www.youtube.com">Youtube</a> but it's constantly removed because of copyright)</p>
  <p> The information in the audios are incredibly valuable, life-changing and used by the wealthiest people on planet earth.</p>

  <p> P.S. Some people consider such material as motivational. I don't, because I agree with Jim Rhon when he says:</p>
  <p> "If the guy is an idiot, you motivate him, you get a motivated idiot".</p> üòÅ
